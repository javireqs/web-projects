                Hi, my name's Javier Hernandez Requena. I've been studying Cyber Security at CCSF for a couple of years,
                and recently got into computer programming. Currently I'm on track to achieve, by the end of this semester, my: "C++ Certificate of Accomplishment" and "Security for Web App Development Certificate of Accomplishment".
                I'll be looking to add a Full-Stack Web-Development certificate soon after and the OSCP is something that I also have my eyes on.

                    My path to web development happened by part boredom and part curiosity. I had already taken numerous
                    cyber security courses at CCSF and I fell in love with hacking. However, I quickly realized that if
                    I wanted to look at myself one day and call myself a true hacker, I had to learn how to program.
                    Not everyone takes this path, but I decided that it'd be worth the delay and so I began taking computer science
                    courses at CCSF. I began with BASH & Python, then progressed through the C++ catalog including Data Structures & Algorithms.
                    After this, I stumbled across a beginner HTML/CSS class in the summer and took it for fun. This is when I realized
                    how much I actually enjoyed making webpages and playing around with some of the designs.
                    Plus, it'll help in my career as an aspiring penetration tester.
                    Here's a link to one of my favorite websites, I really like it because it teaches you the fundamentals of cyber security,
                    while at the same time being a fun game to play:<br><br><a href="https://hackthebox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hack The Box</a>
