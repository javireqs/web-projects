                <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
                <p>One of the primary advantages of using an AI like ChatGPT is its ability to provide accurate, concise, and highly relevant information. The responses are immediate, saving significant time that would otherwise be spent on extensive research. However, it's crucial to remember that while AI is a powerful tool, it should not replace human judgement. It's important to review and validate the information provided by AI using reliable sources.</p>
